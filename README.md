# Tkinter User Login System with SQLite

This project is a simple login system built using **Tkinter** for the user interface and **SQLite** for storing user credentials. The system allows users to register, login, and access a secure folder once authenticated.

## Features

- **Login System**: Users can log in with their username and password.
- **User Registration**: New users can create an account with a matching password confirmation.
- **Secure Folder**: On successful login, users can open a secure folder.
- **SQLite Database**: User credentials are stored in an SQLite database for persistent storage.
- **User Logs**: User logins are recorded in a log file (`login.txt`).
- **User Feedback**: The system provides appropriate feedback via message boxes on success or failure.
